## NFT protect

### What is NFT Protect?

NFT Protect is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol designed to protect digital assets from theft, phishing attacks, social engineering, accidental transfers and even private key loss.

### What is pNFT?

pNFT stands for "Protected NFT". It is a type of NFT that is issued by the NFT Protect protocol at the request of the original owner. A pNFT is linked to the original NFT and serves as a replacement for daily use, offering an extra layer of protection for the original NFT.

### What wallets can be connected to NFT Protect?

You can use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or any other wallet that supports the [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/) protocol. In the future, the number of supported wallets and networks will increase.

### Can I link multiple wallets to one account?

No, one account can only be linked to one wallet. However, you can easily switch between wallets using Metamask.

### Can I choose which NFTs to protect, or will all assets on my wallet be transferred to pNFTs?

You have complete control over which assets to protect. You can choose which NFTs to convert to pNFTs, and which ones to leave unsecured.\

## Security

### Why should I trust NFT Protect?

You can trust NFT Protect because it is a non-custodial platform, which means that you have complete control over your assets, and only you can withdraw them from storage. NFT Protect cannot access these funds, and we will never ask for your seed phrase. We prioritize your security and privacy, and our protocol is designed to ensure that your assets are fully protected at all times.

### Do you see my seed phrase and wallet password?

No, access to the seed phrase of your wallet should be only with you. Do not give it to anyone under any circumstances!

### Does NFT Protect have access to my NFTs or pNFTs?

No, NFT Protect does not have access to users' NFTs or pNFTs. The protocol only provides the technology for the NFT Protection.

## Functionality

### I am new to blockchain, can I use NFT Protect without any special knowledge?

NFT Protect requires only internet access, a web browser, and a wallet to use. We have an intuitive application with comments accompanying every step, making it easy to use for those without specialized knowledge.

### I have purchased pNFT. What should I do next?

After purchasing a pNFT, you can request the original NFT through our protocol if the seller forgets to transfer it to you. To do so, you need to log in to our application using your crypto wallet. All of your purchased protected assets will be displayed in the “All your protected assets” section. There, you will find a button labeled "Request Original." Pressing the button will send a request to the original owner to transfer the rights to you.

### What functionality will be avaliable in a testnet?

During the testing phase, NFT Protect allows you to wrap your NFTs in pNFTs to protect them. As long as a pNFT exists, the original NFT remains in storage, while you can freely use the pNFT on the internet.

Additionally, you can initiate the transfer of the original NFT to the pNFT holder. For instance, if you sell or gift your pNFT and wish to transfer the original NFT to the new owner.

You can also request the transfer of the original NFT from the initial owner when you own a pNFT, for instance, if you bought or received a pNFT and want to obtain the original NFT.

You can burn your pNFT to extract the NFT from storage.

In case of disputes, you may resort to Kleros court (for a fee).

### When will you switch to the mainnet?

We are currently in the development process, and we have a lot of work ahead of us before the protocol is ready to launch on the mainnet. You can help us speed up the process by participating in user tasks. [Follow us](https://nftprotect.app/link)

### Do you only work on the Ethereum blockchain?

The first version of the protocol will be available on the Ethereum network, but we plan to expand support to other blockchains in the future.

## Kleros

### What is Kleros?

[Kleros](https://kleros.io/) is a blockchain-based dispute resolution protocol that uses crowdsourcing to efficiently and transparently resolve a variety of disputes, such as those related to e-commerce, insurance, finance, and governance. Jurors are randomly selected from a pool of stakeholders who hold a native token called "PNK" and vote on the outcome of the dispute. Kleros is fast, affordable, highly transparent, and decentralized. It has already been used to resolve thousands of disputes in various industries and integrated into several blockchain-based projects.

### In what cases is Kleros used?

Kleros is used to verify that the event which caused the pNFT to change ownership actually occurred, so that the pNFT can be burned and the original owner returned. Kleros is also used in dispute resolution when a new owner of a pNFT, who has purchased it in good faith, for some reason cannot obtain the original from the previous owner. In this case, a court can review the evidence presented by the parties and make a fair decision.
