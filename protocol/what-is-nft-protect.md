## Overview

NFT Protect is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol designed to protect digital assets from theft, phishing attacks, social engineering, and accidental transfers, creating a more secure and reliable market for all participants.

NFT Protect utilizes Protected NFT technology and decentralized dispute resolution layers (like Kleros.io) to provide a secure and seamless self-custody solution for digital asset owners, which allows them to confidently manage and transfer their assets, knowing they have a reliable means of protection in case of theft or compromise. NFT Protect offers a unique solution that combines the convenience of the traditional world with the advancement of the DeFi ecosystem.

With NFT Protect, users can easily send their original NFT to the protocol and receive a "protected NFT" (pNFT) in return. The pNFT can be used like the original NFT, including in supported protocols and marketplaces for transfer and sale. In the event of theft, phishing attack, or wallet compromise, the original owner can initiate a dispute in a decentralized court and request that the pNFT be burned and reissued while keeping the original safe.
