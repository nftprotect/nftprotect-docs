# Architecture

NFT Protect is a smart contract system that allows for the protection and transfer of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows for the creation of wrapped tokens that are linked to the original tokens and provides several functions for adjusting and transferring ownership of these wrapped tokens. The contract also integrates with external arbitrators and user registry contracts to ensure the security of these transfers.
