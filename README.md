# Abstract

NFT Protect is a decentralized protocol that provides advanced security features for ownership and transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It includes a built-in mechanism that enables original token owners to regain control of their tokens in case of theft or loss of access. This mechanism uses external dispute resolution with integration of the Kleros protocol, ensuring a swift and fair resolution of disputes over token ownership.

With NFT Protect's Protected NFT technology and decentralized dispute resolution layers, users can have confidence that their assets are protected from theft, phishing attacks, social engineering, and accidental transfers.
