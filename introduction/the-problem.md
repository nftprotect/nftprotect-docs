## NFT Market Condition & Analysis

The digital asset market is experiencing significant growth, with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) leading the way. In 2021, NFT sales exceeded $2.5 billion, and this trend is expected to continue as more industries adopt NFT technology to improve efficiency. The NFT market is projected to grow [from $3.0 billion in 2022 to $13.6 billion by 2027(opens in a new tab)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/05/13/2442960/0/en/The-global-NFT-market-size-is-expected-to-grow-from-USD-3-0-billion-in-2022-to-USD-13-6-billion-by-2027-at-a-Compound-Annual-Growth-Rate-CAGR-of-35-0-from-2022-to-2027.html), with a compound annual growth rate of 35%.

## Problems & opportunities

As the market for non-fungible tokens and other digital assets continues to grow and mature, it is crucial to ensure the security and ownership of these assets. Unfortunately, incidents of theft and private key compromise are too common, resulting in significant losses for asset owners.

Over $100 million worth of NFTs were publicly reported as stolen through scams between July 2021 and July 2022, according to [the report(opens in a new tab)](https://www.elliptic.co/hubfs/NFT%20Report%202022.pdf) by top blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. Theft is becoming rampant in the crypto space. Crypto users deal with attacks like website hijackings, social engineering scams, and social media misinformation almost daily. Installing unreliable applications, losing the seed phrase, or banal inattention makes it easier for crypto criminals to work. At the same time, it is impossible to return the lost assets due to the nature of the technology.
